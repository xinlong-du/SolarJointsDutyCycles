# Cyclic demands on solar structural joints under wind loading

This repository contains sample simulation cases used in the work of [1]. The repository describes the step-by-step procedure to obtain lifetime duty cycles of solar structural joints through wind hazard analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis.
